# UniversalControlMacros
I was really missing some of the more advanced scene functionality on the old Yamaha 01v96 that I used to use on my PreSonus StudioLive 32.4.2 AI, so I made a program to bring back a lot of the programmability and more. With this program, you create macros by storing only the diff on what you want changed which makes it very customizable.

# Dependencies
For this project, I am using Node v20.6.1. That should be all that you need for this to work
